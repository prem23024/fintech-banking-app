## 📖 Project Overview

The **FinTech Banking Application** is a full-stack online banking system. The **frontend** (React) is what users interact with, while the **backend** (Spring Boot) handles the money, security, and data. Together they support secure login and **RTGS** and **NEFT** money transfers.

The system demonstrates how real banking platforms move money safely — using secure authentication, validation, fraud checks, transactional integrity, and a full audit trail.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Secure authentication** — JWT-based login and signup with password hashing
- 🏦 **Account management** — open accounts, view balances and status
- 👥 **Beneficiary management** — add, validate, and remove saved payees
- ⚡ **RTGS transfers** — instant, high-value settlement with a minimum-amount rule
- 📦 **NEFT transfers** — batched, scheduled settlement via a background worker
- 📊 **Transaction history** — searchable, paginated records with status tracking
- 🛡️ **Fraud checks** — daily transfer limits and duplicate-transaction detection
- 🔁 **Idempotency** — safe retries that never move money twice
- 📝 **Audit logging** — a record of important API activity
- 🔔 **Notifications** — success/failure messages (event-based or simulated)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

![Technology Stack](images/tech-stack.png)

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | React + Axios | User interface and API calls |
| **Backend** | Java 17 + Spring Boot | REST APIs and business logic |
| **Security** | JWT + Spring Security | Secure login tokens and API protection |
| **Database** | MySQL (H2 for local runs) | Persistent data storage |
| **Build** | Maven | Builds the backend and manages libraries |
| **Optional / Conceptual** | Kafka, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes | Event streaming, caching, containers, scaling |

> **Scope note:** Kafka, Redis, Docker, and Kubernetes are optional or conceptual. The application runs fully without them using H2 (or MySQL) and simulated notifications.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![Full-Stack Architecture](images/architecture.png)

A request flows top to bottom: the React screen calls Axios, which adds the login token and sends it to Spring Boot. The **security filter** checks the token, the **controller** receives it, the **service** applies the rules, and the **repository** reads or writes the database. The dashed amber path is the optional Kafka notification flow.

### Backend Request Lifecycle

![Backend Request Lifecycle](images/backend-lifecycle.png)

The request passes through the security filter, controller (which validates input), service (which applies business rules), and repository (which talks to the database). The whole flow runs inside **one transaction** — if any step fails, all changes are undone and the error handler returns a clean response.

### API Communication

![API Communication](images/api-communication.png)

The frontend sends a request (with the token) through Axios to the REST API, which talks to the database and sends back a response. The frontend **never touches the database directly**.

### Project Folder Structure

![Project Folder Structure](images/folder-structure.png)

Each folder has one clear job. The frontend flows `page → service → Axios → backend`; the backend flows `controller → service → repository → database`.

---

## 🔐 JWT Authentication

![JWT Authentication Flow](images/jwt-auth.png)

- **What JWT is** — a signed digital pass the server gives you after login.
- **Why it is used** — so the server can trust who you are on every request without storing sessions.
- **How it works** — you send the token with each request; the server checks its signature and lets valid ones through, rejecting the rest with `401`.

---

## 🔄 Workflow

### RTGS — Instant Settlement

![RTGS Workflow](images/rtgs-workflow.png)

RTGS is for high-value transfers and settles instantly. After the request passes the idempotency check, minimum-amount rule, account lock, fraud checks, and balance check, the money is debited and settled immediately, the status becomes **SUCCESS**, and a notification is sent.

### NEFT — Batch Settlement

![NEFT Workflow](images/neft-workflow.png)

NEFT debits the money right away but marks the transfer as **PROCESSING** (queued). A scheduler runs on a timer, picks up all queued NEFT transfers, settles them in a batch, marks them **SUCCESS**, and notifies each customer — exactly how real NEFT works.

### End-to-End Connected Workflow

![End-to-End Workflow](images/end-to-end.png)

This ties everything together. The user acts on the React screen; Axios sends the request with the token; security validates it; the service runs the checks and moves the money; the database is updated; an optional notification is sent; and the result travels back to the screen. RTGS finishes instantly; NEFT completes shortly after via the scheduler. If any check fails, the change is rolled back and an error is returned instead.

---

## 🗄️ Database Design

![Database ER Diagram](images/er-diagram.png)

Five tables store everything:

| Table | Purpose | Key relationship |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| `users` | Login details, hashed password, role | owns many accounts & beneficiaries |
| `accounts` | Balance, account number, status | belongs to one user; sends many transactions |
| `beneficiaries` | Saved payees | belongs to one user |
| `transactions` | Every money movement with status & reference | belongs to one source account |
| `audit_logs` | Security trail of API activity | standalone |

> **Note:** Notifications are sent as live events / log messages, not stored in a table, so there is no notifications table in the current database.

---

## ⚠️ Exception Handling

![Exception Handling](images/exception-handling.png)

Every kind of error — validation, unauthorized, insufficient balance, duplicate, or fraud — funnels through one **GlobalExceptionHandler**, which returns a clean response with the correct HTTP status code. This keeps error handling consistent and predictable for the frontend.

| Error | HTTP status | Handling |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Validation failure | `400` | Returns field-level messages |
| Unauthorized / invalid token | `401` | Frontend logs the user out |
| Insufficient balance | `400` | Debit is rolled back |
| Duplicate transaction | `200` | Returns the original transaction (no double charge) |
| Fraud rule hit | `422` | Transfer is blocked |

---

## 🖥️ Screenshots

![Login and Dashboard Mockups](images/ui-mockups.png)

- **Login screen** — takes a username and password and returns a secure token.
- **Dashboard** — shows total balance, quick stats, and recent transactions pulled live from the backend.

**Main frontend flows**

- **Login flow** — enter credentials → backend returns token → token saved → redirect to dashboard.
- **Dashboard flow** — on load, the app fetches accounts, beneficiaries, and recent transactions and displays them.
- **Transaction form flow** — pick source account → enter destination & amount → confirm popup → send → see result.
- **Beneficiary flow** — open add form → validate details → save → appears in the saved-payees list.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

All endpoints except signup and login require the header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `POST` | `/api/auth/signup` | Register a new user, returns JWT |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | Log in, returns JWT |
| `POST` | `/api/accounts` | Open a new account |
| `GET` | `/api/accounts` | List my accounts |
| `GET` | `/api/accounts/{accountNumber}` | Account details + balance |
| `POST` | `/api/beneficiaries` | Add a beneficiary |
| `GET` | `/api/beneficiaries` | List beneficiaries |
| `DELETE` | `/api/beneficiaries/{id}` | Remove a beneficiary |
| `POST` | `/api/transfers/rtgs` | RTGS transfer (instant) |
| `POST` | `/api/transfers/neft` | NEFT transfer (batched) |
| `GET` | `/api/transactions/{reference}` | Track a transaction by reference |
| `GET` | `/api/transactions/account/{accountNumber}` | Paginated transaction history |

> Interactive API docs are available via **Swagger UI** at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` when the backend is running.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java JDK 17+** and **Maven**
- **Node.js** (for the frontend)
- **MySQL Server** running locally (or use the default H2 for zero setup)

### 1. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
# Run on MySQL
mvn spring-boot:run "-Dspring-boot.run.profiles=mysql"
```

The backend starts on **http://localhost:8080**. Hibernate creates the database tables automatically on first run.

> Configure your MySQL username and password in `src/main/resources/application-mysql.properties`.
> Omit the profile flag (`mvn spring-boot:run`) to use the in-memory H2 database instead.

### 2. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend starts on **http://localhost:5173**.

### 3. Open the App

Visit **http://localhost:5173/login** and sign in with the demo account:

```
Username: alice
Password: Password123
```

> Start the **backend first** and wait for `Started BankApplication`, then start the frontend.

## ☁️ Deployment

![Deployment Architecture](images/deployment.png)

Each part runs in its own container: the React UI, the Spring Boot API, the database, and (optionally) Kafka and Redis. **Docker Compose** starts them together on one machine; **Kubernetes** would run and scale them in production. Locally, you can also run the backend and frontend directly without containers.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 💸 **UPI integration** — instant phone/UPI-ID based payments alongside RTGS and NEFT
- 🔄 **Full Kafka event-driven processing** — move notifications and settlement onto event streams
- 🧩 **Microservices architecture** — split auth, accounts, and payments into independent services
- ☁️ **Cloud deployment** — containerised deployment with managed databases and auto-scaling
- 🤖 **AI-based fraud detection** — replace fixed-threshold rules with a risk-scoring model

---

## 📌 Notes

- This project demonstrates production-style patterns: layered architecture, JWT security, ACID transactions, idempotency, and audit logging.
- All diagrams are custom-built for this project and reflect its actual frontend and backend code.
